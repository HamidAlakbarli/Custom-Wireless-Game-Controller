ðŸ“Œ Customizable Wireless Game Controller with Reddit-Sourced Control Schemes and Voice Input

ðŸ“– Concept

Our project is a fully customizable mobile game controller for PC games that allows users to create, save, and modify controller layouts. The app emulates a Bluetooth keyboard to send game inputs directly from the phone to the PC. Additionally, it integrates voice commands for in-game actions and utilizes Reddit's API to fetch community-created control schemes for various games.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Traditional game controllers lack flexibility, and many players have unique preferences for button mappings. Our app solves this by allowing users to:
âœ… Create a custom game controller layout on their phone.
âœ… Use keyboard emulation to send inputs to PC games.
âœ… Import community-sourced control schemes from Reddit.
âœ… Use voice commands (via IBM Watson API) to trigger in-game actions.
âœ… Improve accessibility by supporting gesture and voice-based controls.

By leveraging Reddit's API, the app scrapes and organizes control layouts shared by gamers, allowing users to import and adjust popular configurations instead of starting from scratch.

ðŸ›  How It Works (User Flow)

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: User Selects a Game

The user launches the app and searches for a game they want to play.

The app queries Redditâ€™s API (e.g., /r/gaming or /r/controllerlayouts) for control schemes related to that game.

The user chooses a recommended control scheme or creates a custom one from scratch.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: User Customizes the Controller Layout

A drag-and-drop interface lets users:

Add buttons (e.g., Jump, Shoot, Reload).

Configure joysticks for movement.

Assign gestures or voice commands to actions.

The app saves the layout locally and syncs it with Firebase for multi-device access.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: User Connects the Phone to a PC

The phone registers as a Bluetooth keyboard.

When the user presses a button in the app, the phone sends a corresponding keystroke to the PC.

Example: Pressing the "Jump" button in the app sends the Spacebar key to the PC.

The PC recognizes the input as a real keyboard press, and the game reacts accordingly.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Voice Commands (Optional Feature)

Users can speak a command (e.g., "Reload").

The app sends the voice data to IBM Watson's Speech-to-Text API.

The API converts speech into text, and the app maps it to an in-game action.

Example: Saying "Reload" triggers the "R" key for reloading in a shooter game.

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Playing the Game

The user plays their game with a fully customized controller layout on their phone.

The app continues to send keyboard inputs over Bluetooth in real time.

Users can adjust the layout mid-game if needed.
